Robot Bunny is lost. It wants to reach its home as soon as possible. Currently it is standing at coordinates (x1, y1) in 2-D plane.
Its home is at coordinates (x2, y2). Bunny is extremely worried. Please help it by giving a command by telling the direction in which it 
should to go so as to reach its home. If you give it a direction, it will keep moving in that direction till it reaches its home. 
There are four possible directions you can give as command - "left", "right", "up", "down". It might be possible that you can't instruct
the robot in such a way that it reaches its home. In that case, output "sad".

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

First line of each test case contains four space separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "left" or "right" or "up" or "down" or "sad" (without quotes).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5000
0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2. ≤ 100
It's guaranteed that the initial position of robot is not his home.
