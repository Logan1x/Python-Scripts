Lajuk is a little girl who loves playing with array. In her 10th birthday, she got two arrays as presents. Let’s call them A and B.
Both arrays have the same size n and contains integers between 0 to 30000.

Lajuk’s hard-drive is almost full of presents and she barely has any space to keep the arrays. She discovered a brilliant function
to merge the array into one:


int encodeInteger(int x, int n){
	n = n<<(1<<(1<<(1<<1)));
	x = x | n;
	return x;
}
void encodeArray(int *A, int *B, int n){
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
    	    A[i] = encodeInteger(A[i], B[i]);
	}
}
Lajuk passed A and B into the encodeArray function. After that she discarded array B and saved the modified version of
array A in the hard-drive.

Now in her 15th birthday Lajuk wants to play with those arrays again. She found the modified version of array A in the hard-drive
but she forgot how to recover the original arrays from it. Being upset, she asked for your help. Can you help her to recover the 
original arrays?

Input
The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), the number of test cases. The first line of each test cases contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104), 
the size of the array. Next n line contains n integers denoting the modified array A.

Output
For each case print the case number in the first line. In the second line, print n integers denoting the original array A. 
In the third line print n integers denoting the array B. Two consecutive integers should be separated by a single space.

Sample
Input
1
4
196613
655370
196620
131079

Output
Case 1:
5 10 12 7
3 10 3 2
